In mainstream municipal wastewater treatment however, full-scale application has not been achieved, mainly due to hydrodynamic reactor-heterogeneity. The coupling of hydrodynamics (using CFD) and biokinetics (using established wastewater treatment models) offers a powerful way to gain insight in their interaction, and to move towards more solid design and control strategies, making full-scale PN/A implementation possible.}
